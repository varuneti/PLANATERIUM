# PLANATERIUM
Revature Project 1

The Planetarium is a web application designed by Revature Space Initiative for astronomers to track celestial bodies they discover in the night sky. Development work on the application is progressing, and the company wants to bring in testers to improve Quality Control to further improve product quality. Your job this Sprint is to perform manual testing on the application with two main goals: to look for defects in the product, and to give feedback on the user experience working with the app.
