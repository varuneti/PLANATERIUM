## Acceptance Testing for the User Experience of the Planetarium Application

#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
Yes, the intended use of the service is very intuitive 
- Everything a user would expect to be in this application is present:
    - Basic CRUD Operartions for Planet and Moon
    - Secure User Creation
    - Secure User Login


#### Is the service easy to use?
Yes the service is easy to use except for in a couple of instances.
- There could be a 'return to login page' button added to the Create Account Page to return back easier
- When trying to create a new Moon, one must use the dropdown menu to switch to Planet and then must use the same dropdown to switch back to to the Moon Creation Form.
- Managing the Planets and Moons so that Moons assosciated with Planets fall under those Planets.
    - Physically placing the moons below and tabbed from the planets they are related to.
- For example:
    - Planet Earth 
        -  Moon Oa
    - Planet Mars
        - Moon Titan

    
#### Does the service inspire confidence?
Yes the service inspires confidence once you log in to the application.
- However on the Create Account and Log In screen the all black background with the basic login does not.
- A more interesting background along with brighter colors will improve the look of the Create Account and Log In screen


#### Is the service pleasing to look at?
Similar to the last question, the service is pleasing to look at once you log in to the application
- However on the Create Account and Log In screen the all black background with the basic login does not.
- A more interesting background along with brighter colors will improve the look of the Create Account and Log In screen
- The main grid that all of the data sits in and all of the buttons are in 2D.
    - Switching to 3D will allow for more depth and a better look for the application 


## Mini Sprint Retrospective 

#### What went well in the Sprint?
- I believe that this Sprint gave me a very in depth understanding of Jira and AIO tests as well as the Testing Process in general
- I did not find a faster way to automate much of the setup/tear down for resetting my test environment between tests and am very excited to get into more automation in the next project.
- I think I did very well in terms of writing out all of my documentation in a readable and understandable way.

#### What can be improved for next Sprint?
- I completely underestimated how long writing out all of the test cases would take and will make sure to give myself ample time next sprint to write them.
- I also underestimated how long the actual testing would take although now that I have completed I understand that I should have worked ahead last week so that I did not have to do a lot extra work over the last couple days to meet the deadline.
- I fell behind my schedule by a couple of days and had to do a lot of extra work over the last couple days to meet the deadline.
    - I plan on working to my schedule on the next sprint in order to give myself ample time.
- I think I can work on my understanding of implementing your chosen testing techniques as I was confused at points on why certain parts were necessary. 

#### What work needs to be done next Sprint?
- There is much work to be done on the next Sprint in terms of development as much of the functionality is not working to the spec that we were provided. 
- In terms of testing, I think that we that the Owner-Planet-Moon relationship needs to be tested deeper to make sure the ID's are all working correctly
